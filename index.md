I am an Ph.D. student in the Agriculture Economics Department at Kansas state university.

My primary research interests are Microeconometrics and Labor Economics. Most of my research has concerned how to use panel data (repeated observations on the same individual or firm over time) to think about causal effects of economic policies.  I have been particularly interested in developing methods related to understanding how effects of policies vary across different individuals.  I am also interested in applications in labor economics.  Specifically, I have worked on understanding the effects of job displacement, minimum wage policies, intergenerational mobility, and unions.  Recently, I have been working on developing methods to understand the effects of Covid-19 related policies.

My primary research interest lies in scrutinizing the unintended and unexplored consequences of agricultural policy. Since I pursue to conduct original and inventive research, I relish utilizing data collection methods such as web-scraping and cutting-edge quasi-experimental approaches, as well as making a considerable effort to relate them with traditional economic theories.
