I am an Ph.D. student in the Agriculture Economics Department at Kansas state university.

Since I pursue to conduct original and inventive research, I relish utilizing data collection methods such as web-scraping and cutting-edge quasi-experimental approaches, as well as making a considerable effort to relate them with traditional economic theories.
